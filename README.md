# WA Housing Price Prediction — ML Feasibility & Discovery Notes (Draft)

## Purpose
This repository contains an initial feasibility and problem-framing draft for a potential machine learning project focused on predicting residential housing prices in WA.

The goal of this work is to:
- assess whether an ML solution is viable using publicly available data,
- surface key assumptions, constraints, and risks,
- outline a sensible technical direction.

---

## What This Is
- High-level problem framing and objective definition
- Lightweight literature scan
- Data and feature hypotheses based on known public sources
- Identification of data risks, constraints, and feasibility limits
- Go / No-Go signals to support early decision-making

---

## What This Is Not
- Model training or benchmarking
- Code, pipelines, or infrastructure design

## Notes
All analysis is based on publicly available information and high-level domain knowledge.  
Feature inclusion and modeling approaches are dependent on data availability and quality.
