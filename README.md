# WA Housing Price Prediction — ML Feasibility & Discovery Notes (Draft)

## Purpose
This repository contains an initial feasibility and problem-framing draft for a potential machine learning project focused on predicting residential housing prices in WA.

The goal of this work is to:
- assess whether an ML solution is viable using publicly available (free) data,
- surface key assumptions, constraints, and risks,
- outline a sensible technical direction if the project is approved.

This is not a final technical design, production architecture, or implementation.

---

## What This Is
- High-level problem framing and objective definition
- Lightweight literature scan
- Data and feature hypotheses based on known public sources
- Identification of data risks, constraints, and feasibility limits
- Go / No-Go signals to support early decision-making

---

## What This Is Not
- Data collection, scraping, or ingestion
- Model training or benchmarking
- Code, pipelines, or infrastructure design
- Performance guarantees or delivery timelines

---

## Status
Draft — discovery-phase notes intended for discussion and refinement.

Assumptions are explicitly stated and may change as more information becomes available.

  Main discovery and feasibility document.

## Notes
All analysis is based on publicly available information and high-level domain knowledge.  
Feature inclusion and modeling approaches are dependent on data availability and quality.
